	originalTableId	tableId	dataType	Empty	Description
Events	ActionGeo_CountryCode	country	STRING	NULLABLE	This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the location.
Events	GLOBALEVENTID	global_event_id	INTEGER	NULLABLE	Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely identifies it in the master dataset. NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is NOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields should be used for this. NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 and February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID sequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events created after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system.
Events	SQLDATE	original_event_date	INTEGER	NULLABLE	Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format. See DATEADDED field for YYYYMMDDHHMMSS date.
Events	EventCode	cameo_code	STRING	NULLABLE	This is the raw CAMEO action code describing the action that Actor1 performed upon Actor2. NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a string instead of an integer, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make distinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer.
Events	EventRootCode	cameo_action_code	STRING	NULLABLE	Similar to EventBaseCode, this defines the root-level category the event code falls under. For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) has a root code of “02” (“Appeal”). This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity. For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode. NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a string instead of an integer, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make distinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer.
Events	QuadClass	behavioral_class	INTEGER	NULLABLE	The entire CAMEO event taxonomy is ultimately organized under four primary classifications: Verbal Cooperation, Material Cooperation, Verbal Conflict, and Material Conflict. This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the highest level of aggregation. The numeric codes in this field map to the Quad Classes as follows: 1=Verbal Cooperation, 2=Material Cooperation, 3=Verbal Conflict, 4=Material Conflict.
Events	GoldsteinScale	godstein_score	FLOAT	NULLABLE	Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to +10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a country. This is known as the Goldstein Scale. This field specifies the Goldstein score for each event type. NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event record being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both receive the same Goldstein score. This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to yield an approximation of the stability of a location over time.
Mentions	MentionIdentifier	mention_id	STRING	NULLABLE	This is the unique external identifier for the source document. It can be used to uniquely identify the document and access it if you have the necessary subscriptions or authorizations and/or the document is public access. This field can contain a range of values, from URLs of open web resources to textual citations of print or broadcast material to DOI identifiers for various document repositories. For example, if MentionType is equal to 1, this field will contain a fully-qualified URL suitable for direct access. If MentionType is equal to 2, this field will contain a textual citation akin to what would appear in an academic journal article referencing that document (NOTE that the actual citation format will vary (usually between APA, Chicago, Harvard, or MLA) depending on a number of factors and no assumptions should be made on its precise format at this time due to the way in which this data is currently provided to GDELT – future efforts will focus on normalization of this field to a standard citation format). If MentionType is 3, the field will contain a numeric or alpha-numeric DOI that can be typed into JSTOR’s search engine to access the document if your institution has a JSTOR subscription.
Mentions	MentionTimeDate	mention_date	INTEGER	NULLABLE	This is the 15-minute timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) of the current update. This is identical for all entries in the update file but is included to make it easier to load the Mentions table into a database.
Mentions	MentionDocLen	mention_lean	INTEGER	NULLABLE	The length in English characters of the source document (making it possible to filter for short articles focusing on a particular event versus long summary articles that casually mention an event in passing).
Mentions	MentionDocTone	mention_tone	FLOAT	NULLABLE	The same contents as the AvgTone field in the Events table, but computed for this particular article. NOTE: users interested in emotional measures should use the MentionIdentifier field above to merge the Mentions table with the GKG table to access the complete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GCAM system.
Mentions	Confidence	mention_confidence_score	INTEGER	NULLABLE	Percent confidence in the extraction of this event from this article. See the discussion in the codebook at http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Event_Codebook-V2.0.pdf
Events	AvgTone	initial_event_tone	FLOAT	NULLABLE	This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen. The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive). Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral. This can be used as a method of filtering the “context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the “impact” of that event. For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence. A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced). NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news reports. It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table. NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal assessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use the Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records.
Events	ActionGeo_Type	event_location_type	INTEGER	NULLABLE	This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and holds one of the following values: 1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state). This can be used to filter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping. Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank.
Events	ActionGeo_FullName	event_location_fullname	STRING	NULLABLE	This is the full human-readable name of the matched location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states it is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when placing events on a map. NOTE: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same place.
Events	ActionGeo_Lat	event_lat	FLOAT	NULLABLE	This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping.
Events	ActionGeo_Long	event_long	FLOAT	NULLABLE	This is the centroid longitude of the landmark for mappi
